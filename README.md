# IQlympics - Global Trivia Olympics

IQlympics is a competitive trivia game built for Reddit using the Devvit platform, where players represent their countries in a global knowledge competition. Every correct answer contributes points to your nation's leaderboard position, creating a unique blend of individual skill and national pride.

## What is IQlympics?

IQlympics transforms traditional trivia into a patriotic team sport where players:

- **Represent Their Nation**: Choose from 195+ countries with authentic flag displays and comprehensive search functionality
- **Answer Trivia Questions**: Tackle multiple-choice questions across various knowledge topics with immediate visual feedback
- **Build Country Rankings**: Every correct answer adds points to your nation's total score on the global leaderboard
- **Strategic Skip System**: Use limited skips (starts with 3) to avoid difficult questions strategically
- **Track Your Impact**: View your personal contribution percentage to your country's success
- **Compete Globally**: Watch real-time leaderboard updates as countries battle for supremacy

The game creates a unique sense of national pride in trivia gaming, where individual knowledge directly contributes to collective national achievement on a global stage. Players face elimination after 5 incorrect answers, making each question a strategic decision between risking an answer or using a precious skip.

## What Makes This Game Innovative?

### üåç **Collective National Competition**
Unlike traditional solo trivia games, IQlympics transforms individual knowledge into national achievement. Every correct answer contributes points to your entire country's global ranking, creating a unique patriotic gaming experience where your knowledge directly impacts your nation's standing.

### üèÜ **Dynamic Global Leaderboard System**
The real-time country ranking system provides both macro and micro feedback - see how your nation ranks globally while tracking your personal contribution percentage to your country's total score. This dual-layer system makes every player feel their knowledge matters on both personal and national levels.

### ‚ö° **Strategic Skip System**
The limited skip system (starts with 3 skips per game) creates meaningful decision-making moments. Players must strategically choose when to risk answering a difficult question versus using a precious skip, adding genuine tension and resource management to trivia gameplay. With only 5 wrong answers allowed before elimination, each skip becomes a valuable lifeline.

### üéÆ **Native Reddit Integration**
Built specifically for Reddit using Devvit technology, IQlympics appears seamlessly within Reddit posts. Players can compete while staying in their familiar Reddit environment, with automatic user authentication and post-based deployment.

### üì± **Mobile-First Design**
Designed specifically for Reddit's mobile-heavy user base, featuring touch-optimized interfaces, comprehensive country flag integration (195+ countries), and responsive card-based layout that adapts perfectly to any screen size.

### üéØ **Gamified Patriotism**
IQlympics channels competitive nationalism in a positive, knowledge-based way. Players experience genuine pride when contributing to their country's success, creating emotional investment that goes beyond typical gaming satisfaction. The personal contribution percentage system shows exactly how much each player impacts their nation's standing.

### üéÆ **Elimination-Based Tension**
Unlike endless trivia games, IQlympics creates genuine stakes with its 5-wrong-answer elimination system. Every question becomes a high-stakes decision: risk an answer that could end your game, or use one of your precious 3 skips. This creates an escalating tension curve that keeps players engaged throughout their session.
