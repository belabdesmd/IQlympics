## üéÆ How to Play

### Step 1: Choose Your Country üè≥Ô∏è
1. **Launch the game** from the Reddit post - the app automatically detects if you're a new player and routes to country selection with intelligent AppRouter navigation
2. **Search countries** using the real-time search bar with instant filtering (supports partial matching of country names via searchCountries utility)
3. **Browse the scrollable list** of 249 countries and territories with high-quality flag images (32x24px from flagcdn.com) and full country names in a 240px height container
4. **Select your nation** by clicking on any country in the list - it will be highlighted with blue background and radio button selection when selected
5. **Confirm selection** with the green "Pick Country" LoadingButton - you'll represent this country throughout all future games in this Reddit post

### Step 2: Answer Trivia Questions üß†
1. **Read each question** carefully displayed on elegant white QuestionCard components with rounded corners and glass morphism effects (card-texture-subtle)
2. **Choose your answer** from 4 multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) presented as interactive dark gray buttons with hover effects and smooth transitions
3. **Get instant feedback** - correct answers automatically load the next question with smooth page transitions and LoadingOverlay components
4. **Track your progress** - monitor your correct answers vs total questions in the centered progress counter below the question (green correct/total format with backdrop blur)
5. **Navigate easily** - access the leaderboard anytime via the circular white button with trophy SVG icon in the top-right corner

### Step 3: Strategic Skipping ‚è≠Ô∏è
1. **Use skips wisely** - you have a limited number of skips per game session (tracked in GameStatus.skips and displayed in real-time in the top-left corner)
2. **Skip difficult questions** by clicking the circular white skip button with forward arrow SVG icon to avoid game-ending wrong answers
3. **Monitor remaining skips** - the skip counter shows how many you have left as a number next to the skip button with clean white circular design
4. **Plan strategically** - save skips for the hardest questions as the button becomes disabled and grayed out when you run out

### Step 4: Game Over Conditions ‚ò†Ô∏è
- **5-Mistake Limit**: Game ends when you make 5 incorrect answers in the current Reddit post with GameStatus.gameover = true triggering automatic navigation

## üåê Global Competition

The game creates a unique dynamic where individual performance contributes to collective national success. Players develop a sense of responsibility to their country while enjoying personal achievement. The leaderboard system encourages both individual skill development and national pride, making every game session meaningful beyond personal entertainment.

## üéØ Game Flow & Navigation

The game uses intelligent routing with AppRouter and NavigationContext that automatically determines the appropriate page based on player state:

1. **Initial Load**: App checks if player exists via usePlayer hook with LoadingCard display during player fetch
2. **New Players**: Automatically routed to CountrySelectionPage if no player found (404 response from /api/player)
3. **Existing Players**: Routed to GameplayPage to continue playing if player exists with automatic question fetching
4. **Smart Navigation**: NavigationContext manages page transitions ('country-selection', 'gameplay', 'leaderboard', 'game-over', 'error') with comprehensive error handling
5. **Automatic Routing**: Game over conditions (GameStatus.gameover = true) trigger automatic navigation to GameOverPage via useEffect in GameplayPage
6. **Error Recovery**: ErrorBoundary catches errors and provides retry mechanisms with user-friendly messages and reload functionality
